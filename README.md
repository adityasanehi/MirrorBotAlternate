# MirrorBotAlternate

A working alternate to https://github.com/Carcraftz/MirrorBot. \
\
For some reason, the Selfbot module raises a DiscordAPI error while sending messages using the module hence, my alternate uses the main discord.js v13 module to get around the sending messages part.\
Did not submit a PR since this is just a get around to make the Mirroring work, not a solution to the API error.

> **NOTE:** Please do not post your tokens on a public fork, even more so when using a Selfbot listener.
