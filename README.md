# MirrorBotAlternate

A currently working alternate to https://github.com/Carcraftz/MirrorBot.
For some reason, the Selfbot module raises a DiscordAPI error while sending messages using the module hence, my alternate uses the main discord.js v13 module to get around the sending messages part.
Did not submit a PR since this is just a get around to make the Mirroring work, not a solution to the API error.
